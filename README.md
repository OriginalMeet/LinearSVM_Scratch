# Linear SVM for Two-class Problem

Use the hw3_dataset1 and hw3_dataset2 for this question. In this part, you try different
values of the C parameter of SVM. Informally, the C parameter is a positive value that
controls the penalty for misclassified training examples. A large C parameter tells the
SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly. Use the whole set for training purposes.
Answer the questions below based on the two datasets separately and compare the results.
Answer the questions for both datasets:
1. Load data of two classes and plot to visualize the dataset on a figure.
2. Train a linear SVM on the dataset. Try to use different values of C and see how
the decision boundary varies. Use C={0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1}.
3. Plot different decision boundaries with different C and compare them beside each
other on one figure in your report.
4. Which value of C is the best value for this dataset? Explain the effect of C in
training of SVM.
